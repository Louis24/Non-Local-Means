# Non-Local-Means
Non-Local Means Denoising
In this paper, a Non-Local Means Filter is proposed for speckle reduction in ultrasound images. Originally, it was designed for Gaussian noise removal. However the speckle noise is a different noise model. A Bayesian framework was established into the distance calculation between pixels. Quantitative results on synthetic data show that the performance of the Bayesian Non-Local Means Filter is able to preserve edges and details of the image after removing the speckle noise.
